SERVER SIDE

COMBINING node + express
concepts:
- what is a server:
    - computers that react to stuff
    - machine and code that handles requests and responds to them
    ie. heroku, google cloud platform, amazon web services
- examples of server-side functions?
    - visiting a URL and then being given an HTML page
    - clicking an invoice taht provides a PDF report
    - Google providing results relevant to your searches on other sites
- what is a client?
    - what the server is responding to
    - browser
    - phone app
    - desktop app
- How does the client and server communicate with one another?
    - communicate back and forth using a series defined by HTTP/HTTPS
- In modern web apps there's constant back and forth of talking between
  the visuals displayed on the user's browser [frontend] and the data
  and logic stored on the server(backend).

- think of it as 2 seperate machines
- localhost and browser
- creating a server allows you to:
    - connections to the database
    - handling client-side URL requests
    - Performing server-side processes
    - authenticating user requests
    - logging client requests
- what does parse mean? parts of syntax in a url...
- Performing logic - the SERVER
- what's a module:
    - something your inputing or exporting
